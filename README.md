## Project Brief
- Write a program to move the stack of blocks from source to a specified target location -> Robot must achive minimum movements.
- Movement of Robot arms, picking and dropping are controlled using the Robot methods described below. 

## Robot Restrictions
- The height of individual blocks can be between 1 and 3.
- The total height of all blocks must not exceed 12.
- The height of individual bars must not exceed 7.
- The target for all blocks is indicated by their size.  
- Blocks of size 1 should be placed in the first column labeled Target 1.
- Blocks of size 2 should be placed in the second column labeled Target 2.
- Blocks of size 3 should be placed on top of the bars beginning with column 3.  
- Only one block can be placed on a bar, so after a block has been placed on column 3, then the next block of size 3 should be place on column 4 etc.
- Blocks must be place directly on their targets, you cannot drop the block from a height and let it fall into place.
